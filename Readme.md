# Retail Store Customer Churn and Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding customer churn in a retail context and segmenting customers based on their behavior. By analyzing various customer-related features, the aim is to identify patterns in customer behavior, predict churn, and develop strategies for improving customer retention.

## Objectives

- **Churn Analysis**: Understand factors that lead to customer churn.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identify customer segments based on behavior for personalized marketing.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning to predict customer churn.
- **Retention Strategies**: Develop actionable strategies to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features related to customer activity, demographics, and behavior, such as:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Churn**: Indicator of whether the customer has churned.
- **Tenure**: The length of time a customer has been with the company.
- **PreferredLoginDevice**: The device most commonly used by the customer to log in.
- **CityTier**: Classification of the city where the customer resides.
- **WarehouseToHome**: Distance between the warehouse and the customer's home.
- **PreferredPaymentMode**: Customer's preferred mode of payment.
- **HourSpendOnApp**: Number of hours the customer spends on the app.
- **Other behavioral, demographic, and transactional features.**

## Data Preprocessing

- **Missing Values**: Imputation techniques such as median or mean filling are used for missing numerical values, and mode for categorical values.
- **Encoding**: Categorical features such as `PreferredLoginDevice` and `PreferredPaymentMode` are encoded to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Analysis and Insights

- **Churn Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize the relationship between various features and churn. Key factors that impact churn are identified.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Customers are grouped into distinct segments based on behavior and preferences using clustering techniques.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models are built to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their behavior and demographic data.

## Proposed Solutions

- **Customer Retention Strategies**: Based on the analysis, targeted marketing strategies are proposed to retain high-risk customers, such as personalized offers, loyalty programs, and improved customer service.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the data and applying predictive models, this project offers valuable insights into customer behavior and churn, helping businesses to devise better retention strategies and optimize customer experience.
